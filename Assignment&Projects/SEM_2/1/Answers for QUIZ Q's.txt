Q1.Why technical defintion of basis makes sense? (LECTURE 2)

Ans. Vector space here is nothing but 2-D or 3-D space in which vector can be represented and linearly
independent vectors are nothing but the vectors that do not lie on each other and are 
different from each other.
Multiplication of each linearly independent vector by a scalar and Addition of each of those
linearly independent vectors can span the full space (vector space i.e 2-D,3-D so on) 


i unit vector and j unit vector are basis vector of xy cordinate system because they are linearly
independent as i have values at x axis(i,0) and have no values for y axis and in j unit vector 
j have values in y axis(0,j) but no values at x axis so they will not overlap each other
(linear independent) so that is why i and j can span over full space that is coordinate system here.

Now we know that basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that covers
or span the full space and that is why this definition of basis makes sense.
(#Put image i,j cordinate system and of the vector space filled with arrow and dots.)

Q2. Explain in one sentence rather than doing calculation det(M1M2) = det(M1)det(M2). (LECTURE 6)
Ans. It is well known that determinant is scalar as it represents scaling factor of an area of transformation in space.
On the left side,the 
Matrix multiplication done is nothing but transformation in space happening from right matrix to left matrix and then calculating the 
scaling factor(determinant) of an area in space
whereas on right side,the scaling factor of an area(determinant) by individual matrix are calculated and then multiplied in 
similar way as done with scalars.
